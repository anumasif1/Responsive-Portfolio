          Hey there!
        </br>
          I am an aspiring Software Engineer and studying web development and programming
          through coding bootcamp at University of California Irvine. 
        </br>
          I graduated from Lahore University of Management Sciences Pakistan with a degree in Anthropology and Sociology. 
          My previous work experience was with a non-profit organization as a Research Associate and with The British Council as a 
          Project Coordinator for their Programs Department.
      </br>
      My work at The British Council was based on a lot of use of programs like SAP, Excel and Outlook. It was during this time that I realized my interest for all the programming and 
      functioning that goes behind such applications. This is my first web page and as much as complicated it was for me, I have enjoyed working on it. Coding is addictive!
