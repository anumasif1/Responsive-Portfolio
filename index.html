          Hey there!
          </br>
        </br>
          I am a full stack web developer with a passion in learning new technologies and solving complex problems.
          I love programming, writing, travelling, swimming and baking. I worked at The British Council as a Project
          Coordinator and a lot of my work was based on the programs like SAP, Excel and Outlook. It was during this
          time when I realized my interest for all the programming and functioning that goes behind such applications.
          I attended Coding Bootcamp from University of California, Irvine to advance my career in programming. I have
          experience of working with JavaScript, jQuery, React, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, MYSQL, Sequelize, Mongodb,
          Mongoose, Node.js, Express, and Git/GitHub.
          </br>
        </br>
          I have a degree in Anthropology and Sociology. I enjoy working in a team, interacting with diverse
          group of people, managing projects and take a lead on assignments when needed. I have single handedly
          managed various projects at my previous job including GBP 250,000 funding by Government of Punjab,
          Pakistan, for Faculty Development Program 2014. Time constraint or work pressure has never stopped me
          from giving my best.
          </br>
        </br>
          I plan to become a part of a growing tech company where I can use my programming skills, develop
          user friendly apps, provide solutions to complex problems and learn new skills along the way.
